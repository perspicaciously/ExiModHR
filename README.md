# ExiModHR
The project (my first semester MATLAB course at MS program for Uni final project) was born as a proof of concept for a theoretical "adaptive environment", f.e. an immersive theater, adjusting different kinds of stimuli in response to human reactions in order to modulate their experience and emotional feedback by some pre-designed pattern (intensifying or dimming down the stimuli according to live tracking of physiological and behavioural biometrics).
To implement this I wrote functions connecting a heartrate tracking device to MATLAB and enabling video and audio playback. As a baseline for prediction I used a real human test data (testing performed through specific functions inside the project as well, the reactions to a set of videos played silently and together with audio were recorded) and bootstrapped the recieved messurements to simulate a pool of 100 control group samples. Based on that data a set of coefficients was assigned to the library of stimuli. 
The code is tracking in real time raw HR + velocity, takes into account prediction coefficients and a set of conditions (such as time to recover to a baseline HR - measured and winsorized at the very beginning of the experiment, steepness of reaction curve of a particular participant etc) and goes through a number of algorithms to choose the next stimulus, that is calculated to produce emotional response as close to the pre-designed pattern of emotional modulation curve as possible. 
After the data is done being collected, it compares the results with the control group data withtin the standard deviation corridor and further bootstraps the data to emulate a larger experimental pool. An independent samples t-test is performed on the data to establish whether the experimental curve is not significantly different from the pre-designed curve (the normalized HR coefficients of control group used to build the prediction on VS the normalized HR coefficients of the experimental group).
In order for the experiment to be real-time tracking and reporting, and for the ease of use while having the stimuli displayed, I wrote up a simple GUI with a number of plots and controllers.
